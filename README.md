# dotfiles

This was originally a standalone set of scripts I collected in the [bin](bin/) directory, mostly for automating the creation of personal [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) clusters via [AWS EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/) for exploratory analysis using `spark-shell`. Sometime after that, I stopped having that particular need, but wound up bootstrapping a couple of different machines for development, and so I filled out some generic dotfiles that I use, both [true dotfiles](https://github.com/slpsys/dotfiles/tree/master/user_home_dir/dotfiles) and moduler [bash profile includes](bash_profile_includes).

Probably don't actually pull this repo down unless you're me, and _certainly_ don't run [setup](setup) unless you want your bash profile overwritten.
